This document contains two newly generated math questions following the specified format and curriculum hierarchy.
The questions are similar to the base questions provided and include appropriate mathematical concepts.

QUESTION 1
==================================================

QUESTION TEXT:
A restaurant offers a lunch special where customers can choose 1 main dish and 1 side dish. The menu shows the following options:

## Lunch Special Menu
| Main Dish | Side Dish |
| :---: | :---: |
| Grilled Chicken | French Fries |

| | Onion Rings |

How many different lunch combinations are possible?

OPTIONS:
[A] 15 combinations
[CORRECT ANSWER] 20 combinations
[C] 25 combinations
[D] 30 combinations
[E] 35 combinations

EXPLANATION:
Using the counting principle: Number of main dishes × Number of side dishes = 4 × 5 = 20 different combinations. Each main dish can be paired with any of the 5 side dishes, giving us 4 × 5 = 20 total possibilities.

QUESTION 2
==================================================

QUESTION TEXT:
A cylindrical container is designed to hold 8 tennis balls tightly packed in two layers. Each tennis ball has a radius of 3.5 centimeters. The top view shows a circular arrangement with 4 balls in the bottom layer and 4 balls in the top layer. Which of the following is closest to the dimensions of the cylindrical container?

**Note**: The height accounts for two layers of balls, and the diameter accommodates the circular arrangement.

OPTIONS:
[A] $7 \times 7 \times 14$ cm
[B] $7 \times 7 \times 21$ cm
[C] $14 \times 14 \times 14$ cm
[CORRECT ANSWER] $14 \times 14 \times 21$ cm
[E] $21 \times 21 \times 28$ cm

EXPLANATION:
Each tennis ball has a radius of 3.5 cm, so diameter = 7 cm. For the circular arrangement of 4 balls, the container diameter must be approximately 14 cm (2 × 7 cm). The height must accommodate 2 layers: 2 × 7 cm = 14 cm, plus some spacing, so approximately 21 cm total. Therefore, the closest dimensions are $14 \times 14 \times 21$ cm.
